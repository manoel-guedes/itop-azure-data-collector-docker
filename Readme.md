## Introduction

The iTop Azure Data Collector Docker project is designed to streamline the process of collecting data from Azure and integrating it with iTop. This containerized solution ensures a consistent and reliable data collection process.
It is based on the Combodo Azure Data Collector, avaiable at the iTop Hub website (and CombodoÂ´s Github).
It can be run as a Container Instance on Azure (remember to set to the restart-policy to Never)
    az container create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerInstance --image itop-azure-data-collector --restart-policy Never
Azure Logic App can be used to schedule runs
